The goal of the computational sage project is not to replace sage, but more to give home for packages and extensions for sagemath, which are important or useful for computational mathematics (numerics, symbolic computation, scientific computing, parallel computing etc), but cannot merged into sage because they perhaps are not stable enough, or other reasons like lacking support for certain distributions, or are not wanted in the community.
Another goal is to try to "stabalize" these packages, and introduce them with bugfixes into sagemath to reach more users, and help the sage project.
I'm doing this myself and encourage other users to do this also.

It is also a goal to merge back packages from the FEMhub project into sage, and provide bleeding edge/more actual packages for certain packages like numpy or scipy.

Since I'm aware that some things are not liked by the communities of these projects, I started this project with the thought that other researchers share the same problems, and want to provide their experimental packages to other users, but they don't get accepted by the community, or it will take at least months or even years to get it into the system.

I also need these packages for mathematics courses at university.

I personally think that provide stable systems is important and correct, but also provide the possibilty for use of unstable packages at own knowledge and risk.

As a rule Packages which are "stabelized" and merged into sage will be deleted from the project hosing page.
As convention the systems on which the package was succesfully tested has to be added.


Everyone who wants to help out is welcome.
